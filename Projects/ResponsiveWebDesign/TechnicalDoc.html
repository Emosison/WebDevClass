            Most driver licenses and identification cards can be renewed up to two years before and after the expiration date. You have several convenient options to renew your Texas driver license or identification card during this time, including:
            <code><ul>
            <li>Online</li>
            <li>By Telephone</li>
            <li>By Mail </li>
            <li>In-person at your local driver license office.</li></code>  
</ul>

 </p>
 <p>
 Driver licenses or ID cards that have been expired for more than two years cannot be renewed. If your driver license or ID card has been expired for more than two years, you:   
    <ol>
<li> Must apply in person as a new applicant at a driver license office, and</li>
 <li>Meet all of the requirements for a new ID card or driver license (including taking the knowledge and driving tests).</li>
 <li>Verify your eligibility to apply for a driver license by visiting the License Eligibility page.</li>

            You may use our interactive REAL ID Document Check Application to assist in preparing you for your Driver License Office Visit. Just follow the steps, and at the end, you will have a customized checklist of the documents to bring for your visit.

            This page will provide you, as a teen, with information on:
        <code><ul>
                <li>Applying for your first driver license</li>
                <li>Transferring your out-of-state driver license to Texas</li>
                <li>Applying for your motorcycle license</li>
            </ul></code>  
            One of the more important decisions you and your parents or legal guardian can make is deciding when you should apply for your first driver license.  There are many laws specific to teen drivers that you are required to follow when applying for and holding a driver license.  These laws do not exist to make the process difficult, but are designed to educate you about the rules of the road and ensure you practice safe driving habits before being allowed to graduate to the next step.  These graduated steps provide you, as a new driver, the chance to improve your driving skills over time in lower-risk environments.

        <p>
            If you are under 18 years of age, one of the first requirements is completion of a driver education course.  You can begin the classroom phase of a driver education course at 14 years of age, but you cannot apply for a learner license until you are at least 15 years of age.  There are three types of driver education you can select from when taking this course:
            <ol>
                <li>A traditional driver education course offered by a certified driver training school</li>
            <li>Parent-taught driver education <code>(PTDE)</code></li>
            <li>Driver education offered in public school</li>
            </ol>

        <p>
            To obtain a Class M driver license, individuals must take a DPS-approved motorcycle safety course and bring the certificate of completion with them to the driver license office. If an individual has a valid motorcycle license from another state, DPS will waive the motorcycle safety course requirement.

Minors
Prior to enrolling in the motorcycle safety course, minors (aged 15 - 17) must either:
            <ol>
                <li>Have a Class C learner license and have completed the 32 hour classroom phase of a driver education course; or</li>
                <li>Present a certificate of completion of the classroom phase (32 hours) of a driver education course (the behind the wheel portion of the driver education course is not required to take the motorcycle safety course or apply for a Class M license; or</li>
                <li>A provisional driver license.</li>
            </ol>

    <p>
        Motorcycle Drive Test
The motorcycle drive test CANNOT be waived for any applicant under 18.  All Individuals must take the motorcycle drive test unless the individuals are:
    <code><ul>
            <li>18 years of age or older, has completed a motorcycle safety course and holds a valid, unrestricted Texas Class A, B, or C license</li>
            <li>18 years of age or older and is transferring a valid, unrestricted motorcycle license from another state or province of Canada;</li>
